        Go Extra Mile is built for India’s daily commuters. Every day, millions of people
        ride or drive to work, college, or their daily responsibilities. This commute
        takes time, effort, and consistency - yet it often goes unnoticed.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-300">
        Go Extra Mile exists to change that. The app helps commuters log their daily
        bike or car commute, build consistency over time, and receive recognition for
        the effort they already put in. It does not ask users to travel more or change
        their routine. It simply makes everyday commuting count.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-300">
        Designed with safety and responsibility in mind, Go Extra Mile encourages users
        to follow traffic rules, wear safety gear, and commute responsibly. Users are
        always in control of when a commute starts and ends.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-300">
        Go Extra Mile is operated by Go Eleventh Mile Technologies Pvt. Ltd., with a
        long-term vision to build a trusted platform for vehicle owners and daily
        commuters across India. Because showing up every day matters — and everyday
        effort deserves recognition.
